<pre>Welcome to UCNTracker 
=========================
  Last update Monday, March 02 2009.

Introduction
============
  This part is missing.

Source
======
  Currently there is no public writable repository. Also, because
  the codebase is at a very initial stage, the commit topics are 
  senseless.

  A read-only repository is at
    git clone git://129.79.155.240/~fengyu/UCNTracker

  git is the version control tool used by major free softwares projects.
  A tutorial is available at 
    <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gittutorial.html">http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gittutorial.html</a>

Dependency
==========
  The package depends on
    GLIB 2.10+:
      <a href="http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/sources/glib/">http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/sources/glib/</a>
      In general, any version newer than 2.10 should work.
    VALA 0.5.7:
      <a href="http://download.gnome.org/sources/vala/0.5/">http://download.gnome.org/sources/vala/0.5/</a>
      I have prebuilt packages on RHEL5 and Fedora 10.
    GSL 1.2:

Compiling
=========
  # these commands should be sufficient 
  $ ./autogen.sh
  $ make

Code Layout
===========
  UCNTracker       : git repository root
  |-- autotools    : macros and scripts used by autotools
  `-- ucntracker   : the main ucntracker library is built here
      |-- builder  : UCNBuilder, the geometry xml parser.
      |-- core     : the real ucntracker
      |-- library  : the library interface
      `-- tests    : very minimal test cases

  This layout is up to several changes, eg:
   (1) there is no place for plugin-modules(such as new geometry objects)
   (2) there is no place for bundled applications

Examples
========
  Currently minimal examples/test cases are given at ucntracker/tests.
  Not suitable to be documented yet.

Installation
===============
  Nothing is yet installed. 
  The library will be installed to /usr/lib/libucntracker.so.

=======
  LGPL v2.0.
