This program calculates the UCN production in a Cylinder cell.
The cold neutron attenuation is considered.

Cold neutron attenuation mean free path = lambda_CN. the event is that the CN
is scattered to a random direction.

UCN attenuation mean free path = lambda_UCN. the event is that the UCN is
lost.

UCN production cross section is a 'SMALL' number in the sense that:

1. We do not consider the CN loss due to UCN production.
2. Based on 1, take a much larger probability for the UCN production per unit
path length of the CN track.
