Introduction
============
  This part is missing.

Source
======

  A public repository is at github

    $ git clone git://github.com/fengy-research/UCNTracker.git

  A web interface is at
    http://github.com/fengy-research/UCNTracker

  git is the version control tool used by many free softwares projects.
  A tutorial is available at
    http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gittutorial.html

Dependency
==========
  The package depends on (See NOTES on the bootstrap procedure)

    glib-2.0 >= 2.12:
      http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/sources/glib/
      In general, any version newer than 2.10 should work.
      Available in RHEL 5.

    vala >= 0.7.6 (Optional, obtained with bootstrap)
      http://download.gnome.org/sources/vala/0.7/

    gsl >= 1.10:
      ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gsl/
      Available in EPEL 5.

    libyaml-glib-1.0 >= 0.1 (Optional, obtained with bootstrap)
      http://github.com/fengy-research/libyaml-glib

  For visualization the following packages are needed
    gtk+-2.0 >= 2.12:
      http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/sources/gtk+/
      Available in RHEL 5.

    gtkglext-1.0 >= 1.2.0:
      http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=54333&package_id=48997&release_id=391012

      Refer to http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=119189 for
      the progress of GtkGLExt getting into GTK.

  Most packages are available on either RHEL 5 or EPEL 5.
  EPEL 5 can be found in
      http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL

Bootstraping
============
  Because sometimes it is painful to install the dependencies, compilation of several of 
  the obscure dependencies are automated by the scripts bootstrap directory.

  Currently, the automated packages are
   - vala
   - libyaml-glib

  $ cd bootstrap
  $ ./bootstrap

  For VALA:
    The bootstrap script will download the 0.7.6 source code from the gnome ftp, 
    then compile and install vala into bootstrap/root.
    A patch backported from vala (pre-0.7.7) trunk is applied to fix a serious memory
    corrpution problem.

    All compilation of .vala -> .c will be performed with the vala compiler 
    in bootstrap/root.

  For libyaml-glib
    The bootstrap script will download the source code from github. 
    The code appropriate for UCNTracker is under tag UCNTracker-sync-tag.
    The code is unpacked into dependency/.

  bootstrap.conf
    This file describes the bootstrap procedure. It contains the information to locate
    patch, and prepare the dependence packages. Lines in the file are executed one by one.

  patch-{package}
    This file contains the scripts to patch the package to fix bugs or to make it smoothly
    work with UCNTracker

  prepare-{package}
    This file contains the scripts to get the package ready to be compiled with UCNTracker


Compiling
=========
  First make sure all required packages are installed, and/or the bootstrap script is
  executed.

  $ ./autogen.sh
  $ make

Code Layout
===========
  UCNTracker       : git repository root
  |-- autotools    : macros and scripts used by autotools
  |
  |-- ucntracker   : the main ucntracker library is built here
  |   |-- math     : math library(vectors and stuff)
  |   |-- physics  : defining particle types
  |   |-- core     : the tracking system
  |   |-- library  : the library interface
  |   |-- buildables : the buildable GObject-s
  |   |-- field    : physical fields
  |   |-- volume   : geometry volume definitions
  |
  |-- ucntracker-vis : the GTK visualization widget
  |
  |-- tools        : tools, mostly an geometry scene builder
  |
  |-- tests    : very minimal test cases
  |
  `---examples     : examples; after UCNTracker is installed to the system,
      |            : they should be compilable with valac.
      |-- E01      : average length a particle goes before
                     getting out of a sphere = 3/4.

Installation
===============
(Draft)
  make install DESTDIR=....

  The library should be installed to
     /usr/lib/libucntracker.so.
  The visualization library should be installed to
     /usr/lib/libucntracker-vis.so
